### Hi there, I am Paula! 👋🏾👩🏾‍💻

![](https://github.com/paulapereda/paulapereda/blob/master/paula_pereda_clouds_women_thoughts.png)

I am Uruguayan and live in Montevideo, my hometown. I have a BSc in Economics from the [Facultad de Ciencias Económicas y Administración](http://fcea.edu.uy/maestrias/maestria-economia.html) of the Universidad de la República, and I am an advanced candidate for an MSc in Economics from the Universidad de Montevideo. I am involved in the Uruguayan R community: both in [R-Ladies](https://twitter.com/RLadiesMVD), a [global organization](https://rladies.org/) whose mission is to promote gender diversity in the R community, as co-organizer of the Montevideo chapter, and in the [Uruguay R Users Group](https://twitter.com/gurumvd). 

I work as the Lead of the Evaluation, Monitoring and Data Unit of Uruguay Innova. It is a national strategic program aimed at unifying, strengthening, and enhancing Uruguay’s ecosystem of science, technology, innovation, and knowledge. Its mission is to lead, coordinate, and connect an innovation and internationalization ecosystem across the entire country, promoting sustainable, knowledge-based development. 


📌 My main topics of interest are economic gender gaps and their mechanisms, early childhood development, and scientific communication, with particular emphasis on compelling data visualizations.

In addition to being particularly obsessed with microeconometrics and R, I am a huge Taylor Swift fan (which can be [checked out here](https://paulapereda.com/2021/01/07/taylor-analisis-de-texto-sobre-la-discografia-de-taylor-swift-en-r/)), and I enjoy doing programming projects, drawing and painting!
