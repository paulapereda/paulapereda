### Hi there, I am Paula! 👋🏾👩🏾‍💻

![](https://github.com/paulapereda/paulapereda/blob/master/paula_pereda_clouds_women_thoughts.png)

I currently live in Uruguay and my age is 27. I have a BSc in Economics from the [Facultad de Ciencias Económicas y Administración](http://fcea.edu.uy/maestrias/maestria-economia.html) of the Universidad de la República and I am a candidate for a MSc in Economics from the same institution. I am currently working as a Senior Economic Consultant at [EXANTE](https://www.exante.com.uy/). I am also an assistant professor of Econometrics I and Econometrics II at the [University of Montevideo](https://um.edu.uy/facultad-de-ciencias-empresariales-y-economia). I am involved in the Uruguayan R community: both in [R-Ladies](https://twitter.com/RLadiesMVD), a [global organization](https://rladies.org/) whose mission is to promote gender diversity in the R community, as co-organizer of the Montevideo chapter, and in the [Uruguay R Users Group](https://twitter.com/gurumvd).


📌 My main topics of interest are economic gender gaps and their mechanisms, early childhood development and scientific communication with special emphasis on effective data visualizations.

In addition to being particularly obsessed with microeconometrics and R, I am a huge Taylor Swift fan (which can be [checked out here](https://paulapereda.com/2021/01/07/taylor-analisis-de-texto-sobre-la-discografia-de-taylor-swift-en-r/)) and I pretty much enjoy drawing and painting!
